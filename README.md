# Drone-Minigame

## Overview
This project implements a 3D drone simulation using OpenGL, featuring a fully controllable drone with first-person and third-person camera modes. The simulation includes an interactive environment with obstacles, terrain, and physics-based drone movement.

## Features
- **3D Drone Model**: The drone is composed of multiple meshes (body, rotors, etc.).
- **Camera Modes**: First-person and third-person perspectives.
- **Terrain Generation**: Procedurally generated terrain with height variations.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Trees, houses, and other obstacles must be navigated.
- **Physics-based Movement**: Gravity, propulsion, and angular velocity.
- **Cloud Animation**: Moving clouds enhance realism.
- **Minimap and Split-Screen**: Provides a strategic view of the environment.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects and prevents crashes into terrain and objects.

## Controls
- **Drone Movement**:
  - `W` / `S` - Move Forward/Backward
  - `A` / `D` - Move Left/Right
  - `Q` / `E` - Move Down/Up
  - `Space` - Increase Propulsion
- **Drone Rotation**:
  - `Left Arrow` / `Right Arrow` - Rotate Left/Right
  - `Up Arrow` / `Down Arrow` - Pitch Up/Down
  - `Z` / `X` - Roll Left/Right
- **Camera Controls**:
  - `C` - Toggle First/Third-Person View
  - `N` - Enable Split-Screen Mode
  - `M` - Disable Split-Screen Mode
